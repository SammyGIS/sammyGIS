### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Ajeyomi Adedoyin Samuel is a GIS and Data Analyst, Web Dev and Data Science enthusiast. I have a solid background in Remote Sensing and GIS. I volunteer, promote and support communities in find solution to real life problems using GIS technology. Show me a problem, Iâ€™ll come back with a solution, it might take time though, but youâ€™ll be glad you waited for it.
I might be an alien to some programming language and frameworks, but the fact that they exist, I will be glad to work with them when the need arises.
For now I am allover RS & GIS (my filed of specialization), Data analysis, python (Arcpy, numpy, pandas , Tkinter and Folium), I am currently exploring Geemap ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±, I  hope to continue developing my skills by taken part in data driven projects.
Beyond all this I consider myself an advance learner, someone who is ready to learn, relearn and unlearn âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡.
Lastly, I am looking forward to be a part of a highly motivated team, that uses technology and data to solve real life/everyday human problems ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”.

ðŸ˜„ cheers
